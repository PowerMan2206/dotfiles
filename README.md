## Installation

You can treat this repo as your home directory. So if you cloned the repo to `~/dotfiles`, for example, you could install it by simply running

```
cp -r ~/dotfiles/* ~
```

**Note: this will overwrite any previous config files you had, make sure to backup if you're running this!**

Otherwise, you can just copy any specific config you want.
